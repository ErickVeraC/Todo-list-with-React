# To-Do Project

Welcome to the To-Do Project! This README will guide you through the process of building, running, and understanding the technologies used in this project.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple to-do list web application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. The project is deployed on Vercel for easy access and scalability.

## Tools and Technologies

### CLSX

CLSX is a utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally. It is used in this project to manage CSS class names dynamically based on the state of the application. This helps in keeping the code clean and maintainable.

### Axis

Axis is a CSS utility library that provides a set of pre-defined styles and mixins. It is used in this project to streamline the styling process, making it easier to apply consistent styles across the application.

## Why These Technologies?

- **CLSX**: Simplifies the process of applying multiple class names conditionally, reducing the complexity of the code.
- **Axis**: Provides a robust set of styling tools that speed up the development process and ensure a consistent look and feel.

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/to-do-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd to-do-project
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version, follow these steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy the project:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

Follow the prompts to complete the deployment process.
